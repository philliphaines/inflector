# Inflectors

A Scala implmentation of RoR Inflecor libaray. The Inflector transforms words from singular to plural, class names to table names, modularized class names to ones without, and class names to foreign keys. The default inflections for pluralization, singularization, and uncountable words are kept in InflectionsResource.
